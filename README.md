# EDA_Capstone_Project_Hotel_Booking_Analysis
Project Summary : In this project, we will try to predict the possibility of a booking for a hotel based on different factors and also try to predict if they need special requests based on different features. The data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. From it, we can understand the customer’s’ behavior and it might help us make better decisions.
